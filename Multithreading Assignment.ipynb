    "\n",
    "✅ **Advantages:**  \n",
    "- **Faster Execution** – Reduces execution time for I/O-bound tasks.  \n",
    "- **Efficient CPU Utilization** – Uses multiple CPU cores effectively.  \n",
    "- **Better Responsiveness** – UI remains responsive in GUI applications.  \n",
    "- **Concurrency** – Runs multiple tasks at the same time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "- **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** – Prevents true parallel execution in Python.  \n",
    "- **Synchronization Issues** – Requires locks (`threading.Lock()`) to avoid conflicts.  \n",
    "- **Increased Complexity** – Debugging is harder in multithreaded programs.  \n",
    "- **Deadlocks & Race Conditions** – Improper thread handling may cause issues.  \n",

    "📌 **Example:**  \n",
    "Thread A locks `resource1`, Thread B locks `resource2`, and both wait for the other’s resource → **Deadlock!**  \n",

    "✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "Use **timeouts or avoid circular waits** when acquiring locks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🟡 Race Condition**  \n",
    "A race condition occurs when **multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously**, leading to inconsistent results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example:**  \n",
    "Two threads modifying a shared counter **without synchronization** can lead to incorrect values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "Use **thread locks (`threading.Lock()`)** to prevent concurrent modification.  \n",
