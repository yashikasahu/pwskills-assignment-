    "\n",
    "- **t-test**:\n",
    "  - A **t-test** is used when the sample size is small (typically \\(n < 30\\)) and/or the population variance is unknown. It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution. \n",
    "  - It uses the **t-distribution** to account for the extra uncertainty in the estimate of the population variance due to small sample sizes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example**: You want to test if the mean weight of a small group of 15 individuals is different from 70 kg. Since the sample size is small, you would use a **t-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **z-test**:\n",
    "  - A **z-test** is used when the sample size is large (typically \\(n \\geq 30\\)) or the population variance is known. It uses the **normal distribution** (z-distribution).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example**: You are testing whether the average height of a large population (say, of 1,000 people) is equal to 170 cm, and you know the population standard deviation. In this case, you would use a **z-test**.\n",

    "  - A **one-tailed test** is used when you are testing for the possibility of the relationship in one direction only. You set up the hypothesis to test whether the mean is greater than or less than a certain value.\n",
    "  - **Example**: You want to test if a new drug improves recovery time, so you are only interested in whether the mean recovery time is **lower** than a benchmark.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Type 1 Error**:\n",
    "  - A **Type 1 error** occurs when you **reject** a true null hypothesis (false positive). This means you mistakenly conclude that there is an effect when there isn't one.\n",

    "  - A **Type 2 error** occurs when you **fail to reject** a false null hypothesis (false negative). This means you mistakenly conclude that there is no effect when there actually is one.\n",

    "  Bayes's theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It is mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - \\( P(A|B) \\) is the **posterior** probability, i.e., the probability of \\( A \\) given \\( B \\).\n",
    "  - \\( P(B|A) \\) is the **likelihood**, i.e., the probability of \\( B \\) given \\( A \\).\n",
    "  - \\( P(A) \\) is the **prior** probability of \\( A \\).\n",
    "  - \\( P(B) \\) is the **marginal likelihood** or the total probability of \\( B \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example**: Suppose 1% of a population has a rare disease. A test for the disease is 99% accurate (both sensitivity and specificity). You test positive for the disease. What is the probability that you actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Using Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "  - \\( P(A) = 0.01 \\) (prior probability of having the disease),\n",

    "- **Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "  A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values that is used to estimate the true population parameter. It gives an interval within which we expect the true parameter to fall, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The general formula for a confidence interval is:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{CI} = \\bar{x} \\pm Z \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean,\n",
    "  - \\( Z \\) is the z-value (for 95% confidence, \\( Z = 1.96 \\)),\n",
    "  - \\( \\sigma \\) is the population standard deviation (or sample standard deviation if population value is unknown),\n",
    "  - \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example**:\n",
    "  Suppose the average test score of a sample of 100 students is 75 with a standard deviation of 10. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\[\n",

    "A factory has a defect rate of 5% for its products. A quality control test can detect defects 95% of the time (True Positive Rate). However, the test also has a 10% false positive rate (i.e., it incorrectly indicates a defect 10% of the time when there is no defect). You test a product and the test shows a defect. What is the probability that the product actually has a defect?\n",
