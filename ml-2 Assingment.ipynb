    "- **Overfitting**:\n",
    "  - **Definition**: When a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "  - **Consequences**:\n",
    "    - High accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data (poor generalization).\n",
    "    - Model fails in real-world applications due to memorizing data rather than learning patterns.\n",
    "    - Sensitive to small changes in input data.\n",
    "  - **Mitigation**:\n",
    "    - **Regularization**: Add penalties (e.g., L1/L2) to reduce model complexity.\n",
    "    - **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance across data subsets.\n",
    "    - **More Data**: Increase training data to capture broader patterns.\n",
    "    - **Simpler Model**: Use a less complex model (e.g., fewer layers in neural networks).\n",

    "Underfitting happens when a machine learning model is too simple to learn the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test sets. It fails to capture meaningful relationships due to insufficient complexity, inadequate training, or poor data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios Where Underfitting Can Occur**:\n",
    "1. **Too Simple Model**: Using a linear model (e.g., linear regression) for complex, non-linear data (e.g., image classification).\n",
    "2. **Insufficient Training**: Training for too few epochs or iterations, so the model doesn’t learn enough.\n",
    "3. **Poor Feature Selection**: Using irrelevant or insufficient features (e.g., predicting house prices without location data).\n",
    "4. **Excessive Regularization**: Applying overly strong L1/L2 penalties, restricting the model’s flexibility.\n",
    "5. **Noisy or Incomplete Data**: Training on data with missing values or high noise, obscuring patterns.\n",
    "6. **Small Dataset**: Having too little data to learn meaningful patterns, limiting model performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **bias-variance tradeoff** is a fundamental concept that describes the balance between two sources of error that affect a model's ability to generalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias** refers to error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias models **underfit** the data, failing to capture important patterns.\n",
    "- **Variance** refers to error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance models **overfit**, capturing noise along with the signal.\n",

    "#### **Tradeoff:**\n",
    "- Low bias often means high variance (model too complex).\n",
    "- Low variance often means high bias (model too simple).\n",
    "- The goal is to find a **sweet spot** where both bias and variance are low, resulting in good generalization to new data.\n",

    "#### **Common Regularization Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**\n",

    "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**\n",
    "   - Adds the sum of squared coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "   - Shrinks coefficients but doesn’t force them to zero.\n",
    "   - Helps when features are correlated.\n",

    "3. **Elastic Net:**\n",
    "   - Combines L1 and L2.\n",
    "   - Balances between sparsity and coefficient shrinkage.\n",

    "4. **Dropout (in neural networks):**\n",
    "   - Randomly drops neurons during training.\n",
    "   - Prevents units from co-adapting, encourages redundancy.\n",

    "   - Monitor validation performance during training.\n",
    "   - Stop training once performance starts degrading on validation set.\n",
