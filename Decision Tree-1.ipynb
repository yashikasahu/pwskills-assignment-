    "### **Q1. Describe the Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Decision Tree Classifier** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification (and regression). It splits the data into subsets based on feature values using **decision rules**, forming a **tree structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How it works:**\n",
    "1. Starts at the **root node** with the full dataset.\n",
    "2. Selects the **best feature** to split the data (based on a criterion like Gini impurity or Information Gain).\n",
    "3. Creates **branches** for each value of the feature.\n",
    "4. Repeats the process **recursively** until:\n",
    "   - Maximum depth is reached\n",
    "   - Nodes are pure (only one class left)\n",
    "   - No further gain can be made\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes predictions by **traversing** the tree from root to leaf based on the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. Step-by-step Mathematical Intuition of Decision Tree Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a Split Feature:**  \n",
    "   Use a metric like **Information Gain** or **Gini Impurity** to choose the best feature to split:\n",
    "   - **Entropy:**  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     H(S) = - \\sum_{i=1}^c p_i \\log_2 p_i\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Information Gain:**  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     IG = H(parent) - \\sum_{k} \\frac{|child_k|}{|parent|} H(child_k)\n",

    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split the Dataset:**  \n",
    "   Based on the best split, partition the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat Recursively:**  \n",
    "   Do the same for each child node until the stopping condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prediction:**  \n",
    "   Follow the tree path using feature values, and predict the **class label at the leaf node**.\n",

    "#### **Example Problem:** Spam Detection (Spam vs. Not Spam)\n",

    "**Features:** Contains \"Buy\", Number of links, Sender domain  \n",
    "**Target:** Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree will split emails by:\n",
    "  1. Whether it contains \"Buy\"\n",
    "  2. Number of links > 3\n",
    "  3. Sender domain = \"free.com\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each path in the tree leads to a classification. The final leaf node gives either **Spam** or **Not Spam**.\n",

    "### **Q4. Geometric Intuition Behind Decision Tree Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees create **axis-aligned splits** in the feature space. The geometric interpretation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It partitions the space into **rectangles (or hyperrectangles)**.\n",
    "- Each region corresponds to a **class label**.\n",
    "- Example in 2D: A tree may split:\n",
    "  - `Age > 30` → right\n",
    "  - `Salary < 50K` → left\n",
    "  - Thus forming rectangular decision boundaries in the Age-Salary space.\n",
