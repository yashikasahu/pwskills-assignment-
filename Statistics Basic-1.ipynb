    "1. **Mean (Average):** Sum of all values divided by the total number of values.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Best for normally distributed data, e.g., calculating the average test score of a class.  \n",
    "2. **Median:** The middle value when data is ordered.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Useful for skewed data, e.g., determining the median household income in a city.  \n",
    "3. **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Helpful for categorical data, e.g., finding the most common car color in a showroom.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Measures of Variability** (Describe data spread)  \n",
    "1. **Range:** Difference between the highest and lowest values.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Shows overall spread, e.g., the temperature range in a city over a week.  \n",
    "2. **Variance:** The average squared difference from the mean.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Indicates data dispersion, e.g., assessing consistency in studentsâ€™ test scores.  \n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance; shows average deviation from the mean.  \n",
    "   - **Use:** Helps understand data consistency, e.g., comparing stock market volatility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These measures together provide a complete picture of dataset characteristics."
